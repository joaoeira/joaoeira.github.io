To address the limitations of traditional exercise protocols and provide an effective and efficient program for our clients, one of the exercise strategies we use is high-intensity circuit training (HICT) using body weight as resistance. Our approach combines aerobic and resistance training into a single exercise bout lasting approximately 7 minutes. Participants can repeat the 7-minute bout 2 to 3 times, depending on the amount of time they have. As body weight provides the only form of resistance, the program can be done anywhere.

Research has found that these metabolic benefits can be present for up to 72 hours after a high-intensity exercise bout has been completed (7). *Me: In a study of 8 obese individuals.*

The exercises selected for an HICT circuit should function to:
1. promote strength development for all major muscle groups of the body
2. use large muscle groups to create the appropriate resistance and aerobic intensity.
3. create a balance of strength throughout the body (e.g., you would not want to prescribe five exercises for one body part while only prescribing one for another; creating a balance of strength around a joint is an effective way to prevent injury and improve movement efficiency (1)) Rest Between Exercise Bouts
4. be immediately modified or adapted as necessary to increase or decrease exercise intensity
5. be safe and appropriate for the participants in the training space provided
6. be interactive with the available features of the training environment (e.g., stairs, benches, walls, etc.)
7. be easily transitioned to accommodate minimized rest time

Generally, the longer the exercise duration, the lower the exercise intensity that can be accomplished. To maximize the metabolic impact of the exercise, time should be sufficient enough to allow for the proper execution of 15 to 20 repetitions (15) of an exercise. A 30-second exercise bout is adequate to allow for this because most participants are able to acquire and maintain appropriate intensity for 30 seconds.

For maximum time efficiency, we recommend minimizing (~15 seconds) rest time between body weight exercises in an HICT protocol to maintain appropriate exercise intensity.

Exercises are performed for 30 seconds, with 10 seconds of transition time between bouts. Total time for the entire circuit workout is approximately 7 minutes. The circuit can be repeated 2 to 3 times.
