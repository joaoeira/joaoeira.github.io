# Summary<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

We recommend that appreciably the same muscular strength and endurance adaptations can be attained by performing a single set of ~8-12 repetitions to momentary muscular failure, at a repetition duration that maintains muscular tension throughout the entire range of motion, for most major muscle groups once or twice each week. All resistance types (e.g.free-weights, resistance machines, bodyweight, etc.) show potential for increases in strength, with no significant difference between them, although resistance machines appear to pose a lower risk of injury.

-   Intensity
    -   Persons should train until momentary muscular failure to actively recruit all of the available motor units and muscle fibres, as opposed to a pre-determined number ofrepetitions.

-   Load and Repetition Range
    -   Persons should self-select a weight >80%1RM and perform repetitions to failure.Evidence suggests this is optimal for maximising strength and muscular endurance gains, whilst helping to improve bone mineral density.

-   Resistance Type
    -   Persons should select resistance type basedon personal choice, although evidence appe-ars to suggest that resistance machines might have a lower risk of injury than free-weights. There appears to be no difference in strength gains between using free-weights, machines or other resistance types.Free weights and sport specific movements show no enhancement in sporting performance or force throughout that movement.

-   Repetition Duration
    -   Persons should maintain steady force pro-duction throughout a range of motion, andreduce external forces such as momentum; movements should be of a pace that maintains muscular tension, not ballistic or explosive in nature.Faster movements cause greater peaks in both muscular and ground reaction forces which likely transfer through joints and connective tissue, potentially causing injury.

-   Volume of Exercise. Frequency and Periodization
    -   Persons can obtain appreciably the same strength gains by performing only a single set of each exercise 1 x / 2 x week, compared to higher volume workouts.Persons should train when they feel physically and mentally ready to do so. Both physical and mental fatigue have the potential to negatively affect a workout and/or muscular growth and development.No specific periodized routine is unequivocally supported within the literature.

-   Genetics
    -   Persons should consider their somatotype and that their genetics will dictate their muscular growth and development. Previous success with a routine is not evidence that it is optimal, genetic differences might dictate interpersonal differences in volume andfrequency.

# Introduction<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

The health benefits associated with resistance training include: decreased gastrointestinal transit time (reduc-ing the risk of colon cancer); increased resting metabolic rate; improved glucose metabolism;improved blood-lipid profiles; reduced resting blood pressure; improved bone mineral density; pain and discomfort reduction for those suffering from arthritis; decreased lower back pain; enhanced flexibilit, and improved maximal aerobic capacity.

# Intensity, Load & Repetition Range<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

We can perhaps define ‘momentary muscular failure’ as the inability to perform any more concentric contractions,without significant change to posture or repetition duration, against a given resistance.

The evidence suggests that individuals should be encouraged to train to momentary muscular failure, as this appears to maximize muscle fiber recruitment
and, according to most of the research to date, will maximize gains in strength and power.

The earlier section discussing intensity, along with the aforementioned research by Hoeger et al. and Shimano et al., suggests that 5 repetitions at 90% of 1RM is closer to maximal possible repetitions (and thus equates to a higher intensity) than 15 repetitions at 30% of 1RM. This is the most common
methodological flaw in such studies; the apparent assumption that load x repetitions = intensity. This, as noted earlier, is a fallacy.

As previously stated by Carpinelli the research suggests that it is not the load lifted that determines fiber recruitment, but the fatigue of the lower threshold motor-units resulting in a sequential recruitment of higher threshold motor units through continued repetitions. 

Research appears to suggest that to increase bone mineral density (BMD) training
loads need to be 80%1RM or greater. Vincent and Braith compared training at 50%1RM (~13reps) to training at 80%1RM (~8 reps). Whilst they reported almost identical strength gains, the higher load group produced significantly greater increases in BMD.

Training to maximal effort, or ‘momentary muscular failure’, is necessary to recruit all the possible motor units and muscle fibers.

# Resistance Types<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

Research has reported no significant difference in strength gains between groups training on resistance machines and undertaking free weight exercises.

There is no evidence that skill development is aided by the performance of resistance exercises that bear some superficial resemblance to skills performed on the sports field. Skill enhancement is highly specific, with little correlation between the performances of different skills, even when they appear very similar.

The evidence does not support the superiority of one particular form of resistance for gaining muscle strength, power or endurance. Therefore, it appears
that how one trains is much more important than the equipment used. Ultimately, choice of equipment should be dictated by personal preference, convenience and one’s attitude to risk. However, machines appear to offer a much lower likelihood of injury than free weights and are thus preferable from a safety perspective.

# Repetition Duration<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

Johnston suggested that explosive lifts would likely recruit fewer fibers due to momentum, and that the diminished recruitment through most of the range of motion would be less effective for enhancing muscle function.

Bruce-Low and Smith concluded that, particularly given that one of the key aims of strength training in athletes is to reduce injury risk, training modalities involving high impact forces or short repetition duration have no place in the strength and conditioning of athletes unless there is a direct requirement to perform the skill of Olympic lifting.

Exercises should be performed at a repetition duration that maintains muscular tension throughout the entire range of motion.

Olympic lifting, plyometric and ballistic exercises remove tension from the muscle and apply greater forces through joints and associated tissues causing a greater potential for injury.

# Volume of Exerice, Frequency, and Periodization<a id="sec-6" name="sec-6"></a>

In fact, most research to date suggests that there is no significant difference in strength increases between performing single or multiple set programs [51, 134-137). For example, Carpinelli and Otto found that single sets produced similar results in 33 out of 35 studies they reviewed.

Indeed, the vast majority of research studies show that performance of multiple sets of resistance exercise yield no greater gains than single sets performed to momentary muscular failure and therefore are not as time and energy effective.

In fact a plethora of research, reviewed by Carpinelli et al. and Smith and Bruce-Low suggests that there is little or no difference between training 1, 2 or 3 x/week for both trained and untrained persons.

In contrast to the ACSM’s suggestions an evidence-based recommendation is that appreciably the same strength gains can be obtained by working each muscle once or, at the most twice per week. We would also urge both trainers and trainees, whatever their experience, to closely monitor progress in their workouts and investigate their optimal individual training frequency using any recommendations as merely a guide.

A single set performed to momentary muscular failure can produce appreciably the same gains as multiple sets in muscle function. 

Training most major muscle groups once or twice per week is sufficient to attain strength gains equal to that of training at a greater frequency.

No periodized plan or workout schedule is necessarily most favorable, but rather physical and mental readiness for each workout is important.

# Genetic Factors and Their Implications<a id="sec-7" name="sec-7"></a>

Carter and Heath recognized 3 distinctly different body shapes; endomorph (a higher proportion of body fat, and generally being ‘round’ in shape), mesomorph (a higher proportion of muscle mass and generally being ‘square’ shape) and ectomorph (a decreased body mass in relation to surface area, and generally ‘skinny’ shape)

Stewart and Rittweger provide a more comprehensive review of molecular regulators and genetic influences, and suggest that these genetic effects likely account for 80-90% of the variation in muscular strength and cross-sectional area within the research. Whilst further discussion of these genetic mechanisms is far beyond the scope of this article, it also seems somewhat redundant to discuss elements that are beyond the exerciser’s control, which is perhaps a reason as to why they are so commonly overlooked. However, their importance is undeniable because they will predominantly dictate how much muscular strength and size can be developed to a far greater degree than training type. For example on a more simplified level Van Etten, Verstappen and Westerterp reported significant increases in fat-free mass for a mesomorphic group after 12 weeks of resistance. training, where an ectomorphic group recorded no significant differences having followed an identical training routine. Therefore, it appears that those who are naturally lean and muscular to start with, can gain strength and size to a much greater degree than naturally ‘skinny’ individuals.

The genetic factors above are very important to consider here because persons such as weightlifting or bodybuilding champions with impressive strength or size and most likely the very good genetic predisposition for building such, often work as coaches and personal trainers and will be called upon to offer training advice to the less genetically gifted. They may do so based on their experiences that yielded positive results. However, anyone with less suitable genetics will almost certainly not attain the same levels of muscular strength or size regardless of training program. In the same sense whilst many athletes, trainers, or bodybuilders will judge their training a success because of their progression in size, strength or other physiological attributes, it may still be that an alternative training program would have yielded even better results.

# Conclusion<a id="sec-8" name="sec-8"></a>

A simple method of monitoring individual progress is the use of a training journal that allows a more specific and individual routine to be developed. Because training to momentary muscular failure with a repetition duration that maximizes muscle tension requires psychological and physical discipline, we suggest that both mental and physical readiness, in the form of recovery from previous exercise, be considered before undertaking a workout.
