-   The argument is for a view of the formation and and function of
    political attitudes in that they stem partly from social forces but
    also represent neurological systems and biological processes which
    then feedback into how people update their processes to select into
    environments and how they perceive and evaluate the social world.
-   In this view, it is not that an individual is born with a fixed
    political disposition, but that their psychological architecture are
    to varying degrees a function of inherited and developed biological
    mechanisms
    -   These mechanisms then play an important role in the probabilities
        of selecting into, or responding to, social experiences

> For example, from a simple card game designed to assess risk and
> reward strategies, encompassing no political cues whatsoever,
> Schreiber et al. (2013) predicted party affiliation with >80% accuracy
> by viewing the participants’ neural patterns during the game. The
> accuracy of this prediction is more than double what social or
> environmental models have produced.

-   NOTE: This comes from a study using 83 or so young adults. Be wary,
    look for replication.
-   Individuals update their evaluation of the social world through the
    often unconscious screen of their political values
    -   Seems pretty obvious, see differences in how I, as Objectivist
        would interpret some worldly event versus a leftist, for example
-   Attitudes then serve as a more universal biological process
    providing an orienting function for individuals to understand and
    interpret the world around them
-   Social forces, parenting, elite direction, self-interest, personal
    experience, all have a role in attitudinal development
    -   However, we must include evolutionary theory into the mix since
        political attitudes encompass issues of group living, issues that
        were shared by our ancestors
        -   Modern day views on immigration, through more complex, are
            similar to the primitive need to recognize and assimilate the
            potential gains and risks posed by different or unknown
            outsiders
        -   Political issues surrounding parenting, sexual liberties, and
            marriage rights are reflected in the basic need to ensure access
            to suitable mates and the ability to have offspring.
        -   The complex modern world of economic regulation, taxes, and
            welfare programs essentially addresses the basic questions of
            how to share resources for group living.
            -   Name a divisive modern political issue and there are numerous
                evolutionary processes that map to it.

-   Different political attitudes seem to have an effect on how brain
    develops
    -   Liberals have stronger anterior cingulate cortex activity for
        example
    -   The right amygdala is larger and more active in conservatives, a
        part of the brain associated with emotion, emotional memories,
        learning and management of fear
-   Studies on brain activation from people with different political
    attitudes suggests that individual differences in neurocognitive
    responses to conflict reflect a pattern of individual differences in
    political attidues and ideologies
    -   Which doesn't mean that liberals or conservatives are
        necessarily different in their risk-taking behavior, but that
        their neurological processes when making risky decisions differ
-   These kinds of physiological responses can have political
    consequences (is it that simple? for me to believe that pathway I
    would have to have a multitude of kids who exhibit different neural
    activation workings and with those differences I could predict their
    future political attitudes)
    -   For example, those who display more negative responses to
        disgusting stimuli are much more likely to demonstrate opposition
        to issues such as gay marriage and abortion (while also
        self-identifying as conservative)
    -   It is possible that those who have a stronger negativity bias
        support what we label as more conservative positions on a host of
        social issues
        -   Idea that came to mind: When trying to persuade conservatives
            maybe you could play with their disgust sensitivity
-   Games that measure risk have also found these differences in risk
    behavior. Liberals were more likely to experiment a greater variety
    of beans (game BeanFest) and often ended up with big point gains and
    big losses. Those with more conservative political views played
    defensively, testing fewer beans, and losing fewer points.

-   People see, hear, and smell, different things based on the
    attentional differences orchestrated by their political ideology 
    -   Smell?
    -   There are examples in the paper of how people with different
        attitudes see different things according to their ideology
        -   In summary, liberals and conservatives experience different
            sensory aspects of the same reality; that is, political ideology
            drives physical perception itself and does not merely reflect
            different interpretations of mutually perceived events.

-   When political partisans are confronted with information that goes
    against their beliefs, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
    associated with reasoning, remains relatively dormant, while those
    associated with emotion remain most active.
-   Most correlations between personality trains and political attitudes
    are not significant, near zero, or inconsistent
    -   The one with the largest correlation is Openness to Experience,
        which seems to have been explicitly designed to capture political
        ideology
-   Longitudinal and genetic studies have provided empirical evidence
    that the majority of genetic influences on political attidues are
    unique and hot shared with personality traits or other constructs
-   Changes in personality trains, including Openness, did not predict
    changes in political values.
-   Interesting point, that political orientation and groups developed
    around those orientations determine what is moral as much as, or
    even more than, morality proscribes political orientation.
    -   "**moral reasoning communicates a political position**"
-   Prior ideological views encompass both cognitive and affective
    charges that are automatically activated to appraise issues,
    information, persons, and symbols, and in so doing update their
    moral valuation in lose with those beliefs and values
-   Individuals rationally promote their interests by forming and
    maintaining moral valuations that reflect their attitudes and
    loyalty to their identities

-   Of the thousands of traints that spouses and long-term mates assort
    on, two traits correlate more than any others: political attitudes
    and religion
-   Conservatives are more selective in their avoidance of information
    that runs counter to their beliefs, whereas liberals tend to be
    selective in their receptivity to information that supports their
    views.
-   Ideologues tend to move into communities with similar values
-   It is clear that attitudes and ideologies shape life experiences at
    least as much as life experiences shape attitudes and ideologies.
-   Attitudes serve as a kind of operating system for the human brain,
    helping to signal which program to implement in a given circumstance
    so as to negotiate social relationships and environmental
    contingencies in the way that is least costly to the metabolically
    expensive process of running the brain

-   Those with liberal or conservative values spend mcuh time trying to
    defend and justify their positions, yet they rarely seem to convice
    one another. Whatever arguments are used only serve to rally those
    with similar opinions.
