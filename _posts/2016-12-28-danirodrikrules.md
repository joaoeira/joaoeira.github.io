Ten Commandments for Economists 
1. Economics is a collection of models; cherish their diversity. 

2. It’s a model, not the model. 

3. Make your model simple enough to isolate specific causes and how they work, but not so simple that it leaves out key interactions among causes. 
4. Unrealistic assumptions are OK; unrealistic critical assumptions
   are not OK. 

5. The world is (almost) always second best.
 
6. To map a model to the real world you need explicit empirical
   diagnostics, which is more craft than science. 

7. Do not confuse agreement among economists for certainty about how
   the world works. 

8. It’s OK to say “I don’t know” when asked about the economy or
   policy. 

9. Efficiency is not everything. 

10. Substituting your values for the public’s is an abuse of your
    expertise. 

Ten Commandments for Noneconomists 

1. Economics is a collection of models with no predetermined
   conclusions; reject any arguments otherwise. 

2. Do not criticize an economist’s model because of its assumptions;
   ask how the results would change if certain problematic assumptions
   were more realistic. 

3. Analysis requires simplicity; beware of incoherence that passes
   itself off as complexity. 

4. Do not let math scare you; economists use math not because they’re
   smart, but because they’re not smart enough. 

5. When an economist makes a recommendation, ask what makes him/her
   sure the underlying model applies to the case at hand. 

6. When an economist uses the term “economic welfare,” ask what he/she
   means by it. 

7. Beware that an economist may speak differently in public than in
   the seminar room. 

8. Economists don’t (all) worship markets, but they know better how
   they work than you do. 

9. If you think all economists think alike, attend one of their
   seminars. 

10. If you think economists are especially rude to noneconomists, attend one of their seminars.
