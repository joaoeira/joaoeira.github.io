title: An even simpler way to add interleaving to your studies

In a previous post I shared a simple script you could use to add interleaving to your studies. I made a passing remark that there's no need to overengineer your script and some time after having published the post I realized something: The script itself is overengineered.

Let's say you have 4 sources of exercises you want to go through during your studies: There's 2 chapters from the book, 1 exercise sheet from the teacher, and a webpage you found with exercises you think are relevant for the exam. The way you could use interleaving to go through these exercises would be the following:

1. On top of your page assign a number for each source of exercises. For example: 1 - "Chapter 12 of the book"; 2 - "Chapter 13 of the book", etc.
2. Go to a random number generator website [like this one](http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/random/), choose a range between 1 and the number of sources you have, which in our example would be 4, and get a number
3. Now change the range so that it encompasses all exercises in the source choosen before, e.g., if Chapter 12 was chosen and it has 14 exercises, then the range is between 1 and 14.
4. Get the second random number and do the exercise which it points to.

Simple right?
