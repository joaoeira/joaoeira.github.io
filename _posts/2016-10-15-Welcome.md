Welcome to my personal blog.

I'll try not to make too much a fool of myself as I try to get a small peek behind the veil. 

I don't claim much in the way of originality in the posts that will follow. My interest in building this blog is to think about what I read, and I find it easier when I have to write it down, even more so when I know someone will read it. No one wants to play the fool.

Who knows, maybe you will learn something new. I certainly will.
