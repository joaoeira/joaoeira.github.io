One of the things that fascinates me is thinking about why the world didn't experience *The Great Divergence*, the remarkable exponential growth in living standards following the Industrial Revolution, sooner. Another way of putting it is by questioning why living standards in the world economy remained remarkably stagnant during the epoch preceding the Industrial Revolution, especially when you consider that the main characteristics we usually associate with the success of our species, e.g, our intelligence, opposable thumbs, high degree of cooperation, etc., didn't fundamentally change from the times of Jesus Christ to today. 

An highly influencial model for thinking about the constraints on growth before the Industrial Revolution was proposed by Thomas Malthus, an 18th century English cleric venerated and demonized in equal measure by many. Malthus put forth the suggestion that the worldwide stagnation in income per capita reflected the constraints put forth by the environment on population growth. 

Imagine a new crop is introduced and for a while your community enjoys an abundance of food. You and your loved ones no longer have to face the dreadful knowledge that you might not have enough to feed your kids and yourselves. For a while life is swell, compared to the one you led before. People are fed, and that's always a good thing. Now imagine that because of that abundance of food your newborn no longer dies from not having enough to eat, and that those born from other couples in your community no longer die as well. With your newly found abundance, more children are born, and that's a good thing. Right? 

Children need to eat. That is, the population growth brought about by technological improvements puts downward pressure in the gains in income per capita that were enjoyed previously, leading to a larger population that is as miserable as they were before. In broad strokes, that's the Malthusian argument, that income per capita remained stagnant because the improvements in technology were followed by higher population count, meaning that improvements in income per capita were, in a way, consumed by the newly born. 

Following this crude introduction, I will be presenting a way to model the Malthusian argument using the model introduced  by Quamrul Ashraf and Oded Galor in their paper on subject  [^a].
