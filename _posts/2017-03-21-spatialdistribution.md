Question: Why do people live where they do?

Three factors explain how population is distributed:
- Differences in geographical characteristics
  - No one wants to live in the desert
- Agglomeration
  - Economies of scale and gains from trade make it so that humans find it more efficient, or more enjoyable, or more worthwhile, to gather in small areas
- History
  - Cities, once established, have a strong tendency to stay put.

The way all those aspects interact to determine where people live is obviously complex, but the authors focus on two aspects that are surely important
- Suitability of a region to grow food
- Suitability of a region for engaging in national and international trade

It has probably been done but I would like to see, as the authors use luminosity data, someone use topological data to see what they can find about city distribution. Something tells me early aggregators, like Europe, will have cities in hills and other such high places, e.g. Lisbon, the City of Seven Hills (I did not know [how many cities laid claim to that title!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_claimed_to_be_built_on_seven_hills))

In the past:
- Lower agricultural productivity
- Higher transportation costs

\\(\rightarrow\\) People had a need to live where food could be produced


Now:
- Lower transportation costs
- Increased opportunities for gains from trade

\\(\rightarrow\\) Locations, such as coasts or natural harbors, that are accessible to trade, either within or between countries, have increased value.

The authors group countries into *early* and *late* aggregators by using measures of aggregation in the 1950s and stipulating that countries with higher rates of aggregation in the 50s likely started their urbanization process earlier. This does not seem unreasonable to me.

The puzzle:
- Late aggregators are generally poorer countries and are, on average, more dependent on agriculture than early aggregators.
  - Yet agricultural variables do a better job of predicting the location of population and economic activities for early aggregators.

Explanation:
- Early aggregators saw the rise in agricultural productivity before the decline in transportation costs so they aggregated in places where food could be grown
- However, late aggregators didn't have that need since transportation costs were lower and agricultural productivity was higher, hence optimal locations to aggregate were different than for early aggregators
  - This leads to an interesting observation where the population density of late aggregators is better suited to deal with current economic necessities than early aggregators.

Another observation is that early aggregators have lower spatial inequality, as measured by luminosity distribution.
