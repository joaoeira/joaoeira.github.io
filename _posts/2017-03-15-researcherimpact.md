title: Predictors of Research Impact and Possible Strategies

*These are some notes I took while researching about what predicts research impact. As such, they might be mildly incoherent, but you may still find something of use*

If you want to become a researcher then you likely want to become an effective one at that. What are the predictors that you'll be capable of producing at least one piece of work out of all of those that you produce in your working years that ends up being impactful? Here impactful is defined as *"still being used, or cited, years after publication."*

The probability of you producing an impactful work can be summarized by the expression \\(p\times Q_i\\), where \\(p\\) is the random pontential of a project and \\(Q_i\\) the ability of scientist $i$ to take advantage of the available knowledge in a way that enhances or diminishes the potential \\(p\\). This implies:

 - **Productivity** matters.
   - The more results you produce the more likely you are to hit upon a particular project where \\(p\\) is high.
 - **Skill** matters.
   - If you have a high enough skill, then you're more likely to produce an impactful result than someone with less skill, if both work on the same amount of projects, each with the same potential *p*. In other words, \\(p \times Q_1 > p \times Q_2\\) for \\(Q_1 > Q_2\\).
   - This \\(Q\\) factor seems to stay constant throughout a researcher's working lifetime, which implies that it may be connected to a researcher's IQ.
     - Cal Newport points out that it may capture a lot of the positive impact of the elite level training early in your career, and I guess this may be looked at empirically, but I would bet it being more of an IQ thing.
       - It being an IQ thing would imply that if you have lower IQ than your peers, then you better start working like mad if you want to produce impactful results.
       - Which makes me want to check out whether conscientiousness is correlated with IQ or if they're orthogonal. If the latter, there's still hope, if not, ugh... ups.


The sample in which this paper is based on is based on a subset of 2887 physicists with a career spanning at least 20 years. Intuition tells me that different fields will have different thresholds for impact. A paper in particle physics will likely need something of very high substance to become impactful in the field while something in economic history might be of less substance to cross that threshold. How you define that "substance" thing is up to you.

This also makes me think that you may have a higher impact if you publish in niche fields, so if you are working on historical demographics in medieval Europe you might need a lesser amount of papers to cross that mythical threshold. That may be a good strategy for researchers with lower \\(Q\\):

- Identify some niches in which you can use your \\(Q\\) to greater effect, perhaps by selecting those niches in which your "competitors" have lower \\(Q\\) so that
  - a) you still have a good set of projects to explore in your research
    - i) This in turn implies that you do not make your niche of choice too niche or you won't have much to explore
    - ii) Choose a niche whose projects are solvable, i.e., that you can actually produce something out of.
  - b) in the case that one of those projects will produce an impactful result if you work on it, the competition is lower.

It's possible you wont produce a paper that thousands of people cite, but you may be able to produce a handful of papers that some dozens do. Is that any worse?
