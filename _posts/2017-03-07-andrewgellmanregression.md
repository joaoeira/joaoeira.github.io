> I train my students to summarize regression fits using descriptive terminology. So, don’t say “if you increase \\( x_1\\) by 1 with all the other \\(x\\)’s held constant, then \\(E(y)\\) will change by 0.3.” Instead say, “Comparing two people that differ by 1 in \\(x_1\\) and who are identical in all the other \\(x\\)’s, you’d predict \\(y\\) to differ by 0.3, on average.” It’s a mouthful but it’s good practice, because that’s what the regression actually says. I’ve pretty much trained myself to talk that way.

Source [here](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/03/07/descriptive-analysis-using-regression-models/). My Intermediate Econometrics professor always explained regression coefficients the first way. Gelman's blog has been one of the most significant new blog finds of the last few months by the way.
