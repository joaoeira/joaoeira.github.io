From [Scott Bakker's](https://www.amazon.com/R.-Scott-Bakker/e/B004MUD7NQ/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1479051588&sr=8-1) essay, ["The Future of Literature in the Age of Information"](https://rsbakker.wordpress.com/essay-archive/the-future-of-literature-in-the-age-of-information/):

>All channels of communication force senders to ‘play the game’ to reach a given group of receivers. English is such a game. The rules only seem coercive, ‘like work,’ when you don’t enjoy the game or if you think it’s ‘stupid’ or ‘beneath’ you. The literary author has to move past these old and embarrassing conceits. The idea is to play the margins, to play the game well enough to be identified as a ‘trusted sender’ by the receiver, all the while exploring ways to challenge their background assumptions.

Recommended. 

Interesting to note how the current debate on bubbles and how Trump got to President is exactly mirrored here. Even the science fiction & fantasy community has its own microcosm of the problem, as envinced by the *Sad Puppies vs True Fans* meltdown. 

Of course, in true Hegelian fashion, the Rabid Puppies represent the synthesis of those problems, as does Trump.
