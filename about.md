“Any fool can see the limits of seeing, but not even the wisest know the limits of knowing. Thus is ignorance rendered invisible, and are all Men made fools.” ― R. Scott Bakker, The White Luck Warrior

Welcome to my blog, whoever you are.

My name is João Eira, of Portuguese descent. You likely can't say the word "João", but don't worry about it. Online I usually can be found going by the name moniker Simbyotic. I have a broad range of interests, as my Bachelors in Physics and Masters in Economics can likely attest to. I take an unhealthy amount of pride in casting a wide net over the Internet to pull from it the most interesting content, to me.

I devour articles, and try to devour books, and while there is something to the "jack of all trades, master of none" saying, I find it way more fun to switch subjects of interest regularly than keep hammering away at a particular topic. Again, my choice of subject in college does attest to this.

I hope you find something of interest in my blog. If you think I am wrong about something, people do tell :)
