My name is Jo√£o Eira and I am a Master's student of Economics at University of Coimbra. I was previously a Baschelor's student of Physics at the same univerisity. 

My interests lie in the determinants of economic growth, in particular the historical circunstances that led to the Great Divergence. I also put considerable effort into getting up to speed with the literature in the fields of cultural evolution and social and moral psychology, with the belief that human beings are more complex and capricious than the usual economic models would led us to believe. As a sort of academic hobby I like to learn more about cognitive psychology and neuroscience, thinking that this three pound thing inside our craniums is one of the most interesting things one can study.
